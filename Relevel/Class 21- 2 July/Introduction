PROBLEM SOLVING ARRAY.....

bigO notations..

Time Complexity -
Many for loops slows down the program

Best Case - Omega(1)  return (n*(n+1))/2 ----- Arithematic progression
Worst case- BigO(1)          ------------- TO LEARN and Solve BY USING MATHEMATICS AND LOGIC
Avg Case - Theta notation

Best case is O(1); in Arithematic formula instead of for loop
